/**
 * This is a general base interface for hooks that implement actions belonging to nodes.
 * They are normally started due to a user interaction.
 *
 * There are two different types of NodeHooks:
 *
 *  1.  non-permanent hooks: do something and terminate.
 *  1.  permanent hooks: when started, they stick to the node, are stored with it and
 * recreated, when the map with the node is loaded the next time.
 *
 * Examples are
 *
 *  *  [ApplyFormatPlugin]: non-permanent
 *  *  [AutomaticLayout]: a permanent hook that formats the node depending on its depth.
